# CUHK
This repo stores all programming assignments/exercises I have done in CUHK (The Chinese University of Hong Kong).
# Description
This repo mainly serves as a reference to the programming work done in my Computer Science undergraduate study in CUHK. Each folder in the repo corresponds to a specific course taken, and includes all programming assignments/exercises done in the course. There will be a specification file for each assignment/exercise.  
  
Note: The correctness/completion of each assignment/exercise is **NOT** guaranteed. Also, most of the codes are **NOT** maintained anymore.
# Contributor(s)
Myself. The use of other people's work/code snippets/libraries etc., if any, is further specified in the file(s) where they are used.
